# 100xEngineers Discovery Platform üöÄ

A platform for discovering and connecting with engineers based on their technical skills, AI expertise, and collaboration interests. Built with FastAPI, Streamlit, and powered by Groq LLM for intelligent profile matching.

## Features

- üë§ Create and manage detailed engineer profiles
- üîç Natural language search powered by Groq LLM
- ü§ù Find collaborators based on skills and interests
- üìä View all registered profiles
- üéØ Get detailed match explanations

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **LLM Integration**: Groq
- **Data Storage**: JSON with atomic operations
- **Deployment**: Hugging Face Spaces

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set in your Hugging Face Space:

- `GROQ_API_KEY`: Your Groq API key
- `HF_SPACE_URL`: Your Hugging Face Space URL (set automatically)
- `ENVIRONMENT`: Set to "production" for deployment
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: List of allowed origins (automatically configured)

python run.py

# Terminal 2: Frontend
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

## Deployment

This application is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces. The deployment is configured using the `Spacefile` which sets up both the FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend services.

## Usage
